# CDE_Valencia_2023_proceedings
This repository contains the data and data treatment published in the proceedings of the CDE 2023 in Valencia.

The CV measurements of this study are performed with a Boonton Model 7200 Capacitance Meter, operating at an AC frequency of 1 MHz, with an AC signal of 50 mV and averaging 50 measurements. 
The data is comes in .dat files with with columns: [Voltage, Capacitance (pF), Conductance (uS)]
The files names is composed as follows: GrowthId_InternalId_Diode_CV_Temperature.dat

The current-voltage measurements under AM1.5G conditions are saved in .dat files, tab separated with two columns: Voltage (V) and Current (A).
